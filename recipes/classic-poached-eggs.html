    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>15 mL (1 tbsp) white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 whole grain English muffin, split and toasted</li>
            <li>Pinch fresh ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a saucepan of water just to the boil. If it starts to boil, reduce heat so it is barely simmering.</li>
            <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl. Stir the vinegar into the water.</li>
            <li>Lower the bowl with the egg in it close to the water and gently slip the egg into the water. Repeat with remaining egg. Let eggs cook for about 3 minutes or until whites are set and yolks are soft, leave in longer for a firmer poached egg. Using a slotted spoon, remove eggs, one at a time.</li>
            <li>Place one egg on each muffin half and sprinkle with pepper to serve.</li>
        </ol>
