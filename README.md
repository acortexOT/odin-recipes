html project

---My thoughts before starting---

The first project from The Odin Project. Goal is to create a website using html that has links to different recipes. Point it mostly to get used to working with html and committing information on git. I suspect it should be easy!

---Coming back after a break---

Ok I went to bed and was on a groove. This morning I open everything up and totally forgot were I was, what I had finished and had not. I had to do a git log and git status just to remember wat I pushed to gitHub! So even this early in a super simple project I was happy to have the clear commit comments! I can only imagine how helpful that will be when I am working on a much larger project, and walk away from it for a few months. Lesson learned.

---Finishing Project 1---
This was a simple website to build and did not run into much in the way of issues to work through. It was a good experience and gave me confidence that I can keep up with the courses! It did provide an opportunity for me to realize I will need to become more adapt at the keyboard shortcuts (switching window sizes, moving between lines in VS, etc.) I also, in the future, may want to consider trying to build programs or code or use bash to automate all the copy/pasting that often needs to happen when building something. I figure that will come as I work through the course - as it seems to be layed out in such a way that will direct me towards that anyway.
