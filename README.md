html project

---My thoughts before starting---

The first project from The Odin Project. Goal is to create a website using html that has links to different recipes. Point it mostly to get used to working with html and committing information on git. I suspect it should be easy!

---Coming back after a break---

Ok I went to bed and was on a groove. This morning I open everything up and totally forgot were I was, what I had finished and had not. I had to do a git log and git status just to remember wat I pushed to gitHub! So even this early in a super simple project I was happy to have the clear commit comments! I can only imagine how helpful that will be when I am working on a much larger project, and walk away from it for a few months. Lesson learned.
